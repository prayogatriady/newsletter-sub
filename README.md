## Getting Started

Explain how to install your Go project. Include any prerequisites, dependencies, or environment setup. Provide clear and concise instructions.

### Prerequisites

1. [Login](https://cloud.google.com/) to your GCP Account and [create](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete) your `credential.json` file for Google Pub/Sub.
2. [Create](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/create-topic) Google Pub/Sub topic.
2. [Create](https://www.getmailbird.com/gmail-app-password/) your Gmail app password.

### Installation

1. Clone the publisher repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/prayogatriady/newsletter-sub.git
```

2. Move to the project root directory
```sh
cd newsletter-sub
```

3. Create `.env` file
```sh
PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-projectId
SUBSCRIPTION_NAME=your-pubsub-subscriptionName
SENDER_MAIL=your-gmail@gmail.com
SENDER_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
```
4. Move your `credential.json` file to the project root directory

5. Get golang dependencies
```sh
go mod tidy
```

6. Run project
```sh
go run .
```

7. You should receive a message from the publisher repository.

#### If you haven't sent a message. Let's move first to [the publisher repository.](https://github.com/prayogatriady/newsletter-pub)

## Project Description

### Repository: Publisher

- **Description:** The "Publisher" repository serves as the backbone of the newsletter system. It fetches a curated list of email recipients from a RESTful API using the Gin web framework, ensuring efficient data retrieval and management.

- **Key Features:**
  - Utilizes Gin to create a RESTful API for email data retrieval.
  - Implements asynchronous publishing to Google Pub/Sub, optimizing performance and scalability.
  - Ensures data integrity and security during the publishing process.
  - Demonstrates proficiency in handling complex asynchronous workflows.

### Repository: Subscriber

- **Description:** The "Subscriber" repository is responsible for processing the published emails and delivering them to their respective recipients. It showcases the ability to handle email communication within a Go application.

- **Key Features:**
  - Efficiently receives and processes emails from Google Pub/Sub.
  - Utilizes the "gomail" package to send emails, allowing for customization and personalization of content.
  - Implements error handling and retries to ensure email delivery reliability.
  - Demonstrates strong attention to detail in email communication and management.

## Technologies and Skills Demonstrated

- **Golang (Go):** Proficient use of the Go programming language in both repositories, showcasing expertise in writing efficient, concurrent, and scalable code.

- **Microservices Architecture:** The project follows a microservices architecture, emphasizing the modular design of components for enhanced maintainability and scalability.

- **Asynchronous Communication:** Effective use of asynchronous communication between the Publisher and Subscriber repositories for improved performance and responsiveness.

- **RESTful API:** Development of a RESTful API for data retrieval, showcasing the ability to design and implement web services.

- **Google Pub/Sub:** Utilization of Google Pub/Sub for efficient and reliable message queuing and distribution.

- **Email Communication:** Implementation of email delivery using the "gomail" package, highlighting proficiency in email content customization and delivery.
